            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In my IoT projects, I needed a way to collect and visualize data in real time. MQTT, a lightweight messaging protocol, is perfect for the task, and Mosquitto, an open-source MQTT broker, serves as the core server. Grafana is used to visualize this data beautifully.</p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up Mosquitto as an MQTT server:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install Mosquitto: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients`</li>
                <li>Configure Mosquitto for anonymous connections or with authentication, depending on your security needs.</li>
                <li>Install Grafana and set it up to pull data from InfluxDB or other databases compatible with MQTT.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Connecting IoT Devices</h2>
            <p>Once Mosquitto is set up, connect your devices by configuring them to publish data to the Mosquitto broker's IP address. Ensure your devices are on the same network, or configure port forwarding if needed.</p>
            <pre><code>// Sample MQTT connection code
client.connect(broker, 1883, 60)  # Python paho-mqtt example
client.publish("sensor/data", payload)</code></pre>

            <h2>Data Visualization with Grafana</h2>
            <p>Grafana is an excellent tool for monitoring IoT data. Create a dashboard, add panels for each type of data, and connect to your InfluxDB to start visualizing data in real time.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Setting up an MQTT server with Mosquitto and visualizing data in Grafana provides an efficient way to manage IoT projects. With this setup, you can scale your IoT applications with ease and monitor data effectively.</p>
